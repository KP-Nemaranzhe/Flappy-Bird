# Flappy-Bird
This project is a basic version of the popular Flappy Bird game developed in Java. The game features a bird that the player controls by tapping or pressing a key to make it fly upward. The objective is to avoid obstacles (pipes) by navigating through them. The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
