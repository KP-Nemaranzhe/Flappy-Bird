## ✨ **About This Project**
Welcome to **Flappy Bird in Java**, a simple yet fun and addictive game built in Java! This project demonstrates my ability to develop interactive applications using Java. In this game, you'll control a cute bird trying to avoid obstacles (pipes) while collecting points. It’s all about timing and precision!

Whether you're a beginner looking for a fun game or someone interested in game mechanics, this project will keep you entertained. Play, challenge yourself, and see how long you can keep the bird flying!

## 🎮 **Features**
- **Easy Controls**: Tap the spacebar to make the bird fly upwards. Avoid hitting pipes!
- **Endless Fun**: Try to get the highest score by flying through as many pipes as possible.
- **Real-Time Score**: See your progress as you go with the in-game score display.
- **Game Over Screen**: The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground, but don't worry—there's always another round!

## 💡 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- GUI (Graphics and animation using Java's Swing library)

## 🚀 Future Improvements
This game is a basic version, but there are tons of ways to improve it! Some ideas for the future include:

- Adding sound effects and background music.
- More advanced graphics and animation.
- Adding difficulty levels or power-ups.
  
## 🌟 Why I Made This
I built this game to improve my skills in Java, especially in game development and graphical user interfaces (GUI). It was an excellent opportunity to apply my knowledge of object-oriented programming and to create something fun and interactive!
